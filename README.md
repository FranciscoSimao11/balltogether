# Ball Together

## Built using ReactJS

Ball Together aims to solve a problem that we have been through before which prevented us from having fun at times. We wanted to organize a friendly 5v5 football match, for example, but it was always tough to find 10 people who were available to play at the same time. And so we thought we could do something about that and aid those in the same situation with our application. We allow you to host your own matches and invite your friends or join matches that have already been created. You can play with friends or with people you haven’t met yet, so it’s easier to find enough people to play with. You can create your own account and customize your profile. You’re able to add friends and see other player’s profiles. And, above all, you’re able to search for matches with filters so you can find the perfect match to jump in and show your skills!



In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npx json-server --watch data/db.json --port 8000`

Runs a local server with a database in a json format, perfect for development purposes. This server will run on port 8000. By default it would run on port 3000 but we already have our application running on that port, so we'll force it to the port 8000.
